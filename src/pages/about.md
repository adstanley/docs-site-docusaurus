# About Me

## Hello, I'm Alex Stanley

I'm a software engineer with a passion for hardware interfaces and embedded systems. My interests span across the full technology stack, from writing low-level firmware for microcontrollers to designing intuitive user interfaces.

## Technical Background

My journey in technology began with an electrical engineering foundation, which evolved into a deeper interest in the software that powers hardware devices. I specialize in:

- **Embedded Systems**: Developing firmware for resource-constrained devices using C/C++ and MicroPython
- **IoT Solutions**: Creating connected systems that collect and process data in real-time
- **Full-Stack Development**: Building web applications with modern frameworks and technologies
- **Hardware Design**: Designing custom PCBs and electronic systems for specific applications

## Professional Philosophy

I believe that the best technology solutions come from understanding both the technical constraints and the human needs they address. My approach combines:

- **Practical Problem-Solving**: Finding efficient solutions that work reliably in the real world
- **Clean, Maintainable Code**: Writing software that's not just functional, but also readable and maintainable
- **Open Source Contribution**: Sharing knowledge and collaborating with the wider tech community
- **Continuous Learning**: Staying curious and adapting to the ever-evolving technology landscape

## Current Focus

Recently, I've been focused on environmental monitoring systems, exploring how IoT devices can help us better understand and protect our surroundings. This includes working with gas sensors, weather monitoring equipment, and data visualization tools.

## Beyond Coding

When I'm not writing code or soldering components, you might find me:
- Hiking in the mountains with my camera
- Experimenting with new cooking recipes
- Reading science fiction or technical books
- Contributing to open-source projects
